<p>This is an updated test page with some random changes.</p>

<p>Let's talk about manatees. Manatees, also known as sea cows, are large aquatic mammals known for their slow, graceful movements. They are herbivores, feeding on a variety of submerged plants in warm coastal waters.</p>

<p>Manatees are gentle creatures and are known to be quite curious. They often approach humans in the water, which has led to numerous interactions between manatees and swimmers. Despite their large size, manatees pose no threat to humans and are in fact quite friendly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, manatees are an endangered species. Their populations have been declining due to a variety of factors, including habitat loss and collisions with boats. Efforts are being made to protect these beautiful creatures and their habitats.</p>
