<p class="mt-3">
    Manatees are gentle marine mammals also known as "sea cows". These peaceful creatures can grow up to 13 feet long and weigh up to 3,500 pounds! Despite their size, they're herbivores that spend most of their time grazing on water plants. Found in warm coastal waters, manatees are known for their curious and friendly nature.
