# Code Conventions

## Documentation

1. Create small, focused notes near relevant code blocks to explain:
   - The purpose of complex logic
   - Any non-obvious design decisions
   - Important implementation details
   - Known limitations or edge cases

Example:
```csharp
// Note: Using StringBuilder here for better performance with large strings
var builder = new StringBuilder();
```

These inline notes should be:
- Concise and to the point
- Located as close as possible to the relevant code
- Written in clear, simple language
- Updated when the related code changes
